Many physical systems are intrinsically continuous, with light being the prototypical example. Such systems reside in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, offering a paradigm for quantum computation which is distinct from the qubit model. This continuous-variable model takes its name from the fact that the quantum operators underlying the model have continuous spectra.
The CV model is a natural fit for simulating bosonic systems (electromagnetic fields, harmonic oscillators, phonons, Bose-Einstein condensates, or optomechanical resonators) and for settings where continuous quantum operators – such as position & momentum – are present. Even in classical computing, recent advances from deep learning have demonstrated the power and flexibility of a continuous picture of computation.
The Quantum Machine Learning Toolbox (QMLT) is a Strawberry Fields application that simplifies the optimization of variational quantum circuits (also known as parametrized quantum circuits). Tasks for the QMLT range from variational eigensolvers and unitary learning to supervised and unsupervised machine learning with models based on a parametrized circuit.
